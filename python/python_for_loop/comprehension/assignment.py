# So far you have learned that Python has different techniques to modify a given iterator sequence such as list or dictionary using comprehensions,
# map() function and so on. Now you will be utilising what you have learned. Let’s say you have a list of employee data for the Little Lemon company.
# You want to create login accounts for the employees and you will create usernames for these employees in the first example.

# You also want to update the roster for these employees on the calendar and want easy access to their initials and employee IDs, 
# as they are all unique.
# To get that, in the second example, you will create a dictionary with the required information.

# Input data: List of dictionaries
