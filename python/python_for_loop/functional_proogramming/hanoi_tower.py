# The objective is to move n number of disks from one tower to another following a set of rules. These rules are as follows: 

# Only one disk can be moved at a time 

# Only the upper disk of any of the towers can be moved 

# Larger disks cannot be placed over smaller disks

# In the optimal scenario of solving the puzzle, the total moves will be 2^n â€“ 1 where n is the number of disks that need to be moved.

# Now let's examine how you can write code for this in Python... USing Recusion
